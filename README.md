## ***Hello!***
I'm Ruige, a student-developer from Turkey.
I'm interested in Java & libGDX, along with custom ROMs for Android devices

My dream is to start an actual phone brand, but to do that, I'm planning to start with an accessory brand. (Though not soon yet ðŸ˜…)

My current projects are: (not here)
 - RygPlaza: 1stNUP beautifier written with Python, helping for easier 1stNUP.xml editing for the Wii U
 - RygUI: AOSP 11 GSI direct modification with custom elements
 - Smartphone Creator 2023: A clone of *Smartphone Tycoon*
 - YAUACRG: Yet Another Unknown and Complicated Rhythm Game - Small rhythm game project I was working on (I quite need help with this, please reach me out!)
 - Wii U Phone: A clone of [*Wii Phone*](https://www.github.com/KaruzoHikari/WiiPhone) but Wii U styled
